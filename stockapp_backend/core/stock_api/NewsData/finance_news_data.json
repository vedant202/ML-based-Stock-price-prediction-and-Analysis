It will help integrate apps on different modes of transport -metro, buses, and auto rickshaws- on the network, giving customers the option to book rides on a single platform. \nONDC partnered with Bengaluru-based Namma Yatri, an auto rickshaw hailing mobile application, at a time when companies like Ola and Uber are dominating a large part of the market, while users continue to face the brunt of surge pricing and cancellations. \n\"To make transportation convenient and affordable in our growing cities, it is important to provide a seamless experience to users. Open systems like ONDC enable the collaboration and interoperability needed to make it happen,\" Anurag Jain, Secretary of Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade, said in a statement. \nNamma Yatri, built and launched by Juspay Technologies in partnership with auto drivers in Bengaluru, has a network of 45,000 drivers, the companies said in a statement. \nNone \n"}]
